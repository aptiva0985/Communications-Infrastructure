18-842 Lab 0 Communications Infrastructure

An abstraction of the interprocess communication mechanisms that will be used for further labs.
This communications “shim” will allow for fine grained testing and control of message passing between well-defined processes in 
a distributed system. Further, a sample configuration harness will be developed.
